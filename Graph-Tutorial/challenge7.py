Chapter 7: How to Win Friends and Influence Users

Google's PageRank algorithm is what they use to show you the most relevant search results for your query.
Through this, Google influences what you see on that first page every single time you search something
(and how often are you going past the first page?)

PageRank Your Friends

PageRank is currently implemented using concepts from graph theory,
assigning scores of "relevance" to links.
We're going to model that by doing the same thing to our social networks (what,
you've never ranked your friends before?). This is how social media influence is
calculated! Let's find out which of our fake friends have the most influence in the network:

Note: For the below challenge, you'll be using a directed weighted graph from
the starter code, which can be found here

CODE GOES HERE

walk through implementing page rank on the graph, step by step
Clique through

So now you've ranked your fake friends (do they feel real, yet?), but as with
any large group of people, smaller groups start to form within the larger ones.
We can find these cliques through graph theory! One more chapter to go, you got this!
