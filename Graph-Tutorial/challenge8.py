Chapter 8: On Wednesdays We Wear Pink

Find “cliques” of friends (small groups of tightly-connected users), etc…

While we are confident that we're not bound by wearing pink on Wednesdays,
solving clique problems is a whole other issue. These problems tend to be challenging,
but it's nothing we can't take on!

Clique Discovery

Among other applications, the clique problem can arise in a social network.
With our social network, a clique will represent a subset of people (nodes) who
all know each other (share edges), and we can use various algorithms to find these cliques.

Challenge: Write a function that given a graph as input, finds INSERT SOMETHING ABOUT CLIQUES

CODE GOES HERE
